NTU Stars AI based WEB APP to generate schedule based on degree audit image and user input
A webapp based on jupyter notebook that uses user uploaded degree audit image and user inputs like faculty, year of study, desired courses. desired AUs to generate a schedule 
Schedule takes into consideration constraints such as: ensuring courses do not clash on user behalf, maximum number of AUs user would like to take, courses already taken in the past based on degree audit etc. 
Unlike most stars based solution, we do not require manual input of courses taken as we do it for you or reshuffling of schedule due to clashes as we keep implementing every combination till we make sure it does not clash for you 
Scedule implements AI based solutions : image to text converter, machine learning, and reinforcement learning 
Implementation of multiple python libraries for data analysis, filtering and visulisation like Gantt Chart to plot schedule
